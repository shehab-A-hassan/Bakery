# 🍞 Bakery Website

This is the first project I created while learning web development using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

The website is a simple front-end template for a bakery and includes the following sections:
- Home
- About Us
- Product Menu
- Contact Us

The purpose of this project is to practice building static HTML pages and styling them manually using CSS.
